## Syntax	
The rules that define the structure of the language for python is called its syntax.

## Tuples

## Venn diagram	
A Venn diagram is a graphical representation that uses overlapping circles to illustrate the relationships and commonalities between sets or groups of items.

## Versatile data	
Versatile data, in a general context, refers to data that can be used in multiple ways, is adaptable to different applications or purposes, and is not restricted to a specific use case.
